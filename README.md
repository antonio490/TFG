> Summary

The Android application developed, is capable of an early screening child disorder. The
application consists of various simple puzzles that challenges the user to focus in one or two
features of the images (shape, color, size) and to solve the puzzle according to those features.
Researches show that some child disorders can be detected by tracking the behavior of the
child when he or she plays. Therefore the main objective of the application is to notify whenever
a child´s behavior is unusual and also as a breakthrough into the child learning ability.
